```rust
// My engineering principles:
fn main() {
    let safety = Safety::without("GC");
    let performance = Performance::without("UB");
    let productivity = Productivity::with("Cargo");
    
    System::build()
        .using(safety)
        .leveraging(performance)
        .enhancing(productivity)
        .compile_to("reliable_magic");
}
```
